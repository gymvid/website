      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        In the last 6 months, manual workout logging apps lost <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">\$150K/month</span> in revenue.

      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        The market is speaking: People want Strava for strength training… But nobody's built it yet.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">

      <div class="body-text">
        Then they close the camera, open a different app, and manually type in everything they just recorded on video.

        These are the major players in the gym logging space:
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Strong:</strong> The OG. Been around 14 years. Pure utility app focused on manual logging.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Hevy:</strong> The up and comer. Been around 6 years. Added basic social features (share workouts, gym selfies).
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Liftoff:</strong> The new kid. 4 years old. Added gamification (leaderboards, challenges).
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Here's what SensorTower data reveals…</strong>
      </div>

          <td style="color: #007AFF;"><strong>+47% (+\$140k)</strong></td>
        </tr>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>The thesis:</strong> Manual logging is dying. Social and gamification are winning. But execution is weak.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #8E8E93;">Hevy's "social":</strong> Placeholder images with text summaries. You can share workouts and compare lifts, but there's nothing to actually watch. Just boring thumbnails.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #8E8E93;">Liftoff's "gamification":</strong> Cartoon elephants, a mascot named "Jymbo," egg currency, "GymBros Inc" branding. Alienates mainstream users with extreme bro-culture positioning.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Yet both are growing despite weak execution.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>And most importantly - neither is Strava.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        They're all stuck in manual logging with bolt-on features.
      </div>

      <div style="border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 28px 0; height: 0;"></div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">This is the Instagram vs TikTok Moment for Fitness</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        We watched this exact pattern in content:
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        • Instagram dominated with images (2015-2020)<br/>
        • TikTok demolished them with video (2020-2024)<br/>
        • Instagram copied with Reels, never recovered
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Hevy is Instagram 2010. Liftoff has gamification with childish branding. Both growing despite weak execution.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>The market is ready for video. And nobody's built it yet.</strong>
      </div>

      <div style="border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 28px 0; height: 0;"></div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">Why Video Changes Everything</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        For strength training, video is the GPS.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Strava worked because GPS made tracking automatic. You run, your phone tracks it, done.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        People already film workouts constantly. Open Instagram or TikTok and search #gym - you'll find millions of posts proving the behaviour exists at scale. But right now, all that footage is being wasted.
      </div>

      <div style="border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 28px 0; height: 0;"></div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">Here's proof the technology works…</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        An app called Cal AI just validated this exact approach.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Users take a photo of their meal. AI estimates calories and macros.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        They went from zero to <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">\$30M projected revenue in 2 years</span> competing against MyFitnessPal.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        If AI works for static images (meals), it works for video — which provides exponentially more data for movement analysis.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Strava launched when GPS became ubiquitous (2009).
        We're launching when computer vision became commercially viable (2025).
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        GymVid = Strava's formula applied to strength training:
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Strava</strong><br/>
        Automatic logging (GPS)<br/>
        Social feed (activities)<br/>
        Verified competition (segments, KOMs)<br/>
        Creator platform (clubs, routes)

        Creator platform (trainers monetize)
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>The user experience:</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        → Film your set<br/>
        → AI detects exercise, counts reps, estimates weight<br/>

        → Post to feed with verified proof<br/>
        → Compete on global leaderboards (filtered by age/gender/weight class)<br/>
        → Follow other lifters, watch their workouts, build community
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>No manual entry. No fake weights. Just film and lift.</strong>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">Why Strength Training is Compelling</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        In full transparency - the total addressable market is smaller than running/cycling…
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        But here's what makes it attractive:
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">1)</strong> <strong>Higher engagement:</strong> Lifters train 4-5x/week vs runners/cyclists 2-3x/week
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">2)</strong> <strong>Higher monetization:</strong> Strength athletes spend more on coaching, programs, and tracking
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">3)</strong> <strong>No dominant player:</strong> Strava owns running/cycling. Strength is fragmented across weak apps
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">4)</strong> <strong>Creator economy:</strong> 2M+ personal trainers globally need a platform to build following and attract clients. Strava doesn't serve this.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>The market is smaller but more engaged, pays more, and has no category leader yet.</strong>
      </div>

      <div style="border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 28px 0; height: 0;"></div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong style="color: #007AFF;">Who Am I?</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I've been in gyms since I left high school - 15 years now.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I started with a local PT business, opened a gym, then sold it (still operating today).
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I then partnered with Stephanie Sanzo to build her fitness media channels - we now reach <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">5M+ people</span> worldwide across Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Together we've created content that's generated over <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">1 billion views.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        From 2018-2022, Stephanie was a global trainer on the Sweat app as they scaled to 30M users and a <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">\$200M exit</span> to iFIT.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I co-managed that partnership - which gave us insider insight into how world-class fitness apps operate at scale.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        This prompted us to build our own platform: LIFTit.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Built exclusively for Stephanie's audience, it's now live in app stores with <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">50K+ downloads</span> and <span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">1,000+ five-star reviews.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        Throughout all these experiences - I've fallen in love with tech. And with everything I know about strength training, I can see a massive opportunity with GymVid.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Most founders pitch "Strava for X" without understanding why Strava worked or having domain expertise.</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I've filmed fitness content that scaled to 1B+ views, launched a fitness app that's live in stores, and got a front-row seat watching a fitness app scale to \$200M.
      </div>

      <div style="border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 28px 0; height: 0;"></div>

      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        I've partnered with Shine Dezign to help launch GymVid - we've worked together for nearly 3 years across multiple ventures, including building LIFTit.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        They've assigned a full development team to GymVid under my product direction.
      </div>

      <div class="body-text">
        We structured this as a performance-based equity partnership (up to 22.5% to Shine upon hitting development milestones) with fixed cash recovery upon revenue generation.

      <div class="body-text">
        <strong>No runway pressure. Just execution.</strong>

        • Complete technical rebuild (18-24 months minimum)<br/>
        • Computer vision expertise they don't have in-house<br/>

      <div class="body-text">

        Strava proved the model works in running/cycling. The market just proved strength trainers want social and competition (<span style="color: #007AFF; font-weight: 600;">\$340K/mo in 6 months</span>).

        <strong style="color: #1C1C1E;">P.S.</strong> Strava took 10 years to hit \$200M revenue. We have their playbook, better technology (AI vs GPS), Day 1 distribution (5M followers), and a market with no dominant player. The window is now.
